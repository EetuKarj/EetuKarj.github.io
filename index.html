    <p class="about-me">Morjes! I am Eetu Karjalainen I have one little
        dream. That is coding. Making websites. Quit my job as a chef that I have been doing last 8years.
        I have feeling that I have seen everything in this industry so it is time to move on.
        What I do in my spare time. I love cycling long distances just for fun. I do it mainly on road but sometimes allso on gravel.
        I have girlfriend and we have been together allmost eight year (that is sick).
